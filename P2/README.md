# Azure App Svc: Build a CI/CD Pipeline

This project demonstrates how to build and deploy a Python-based Machine Learning API using Flask, GitHub Actions, and Azure Pipelines. It automates Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD) to ensure efficient and reliable deployment to Azure App Services.

## üìå Key Features
- CI/CD Pipeline: Automates linting, testing, and deployment.
- GitHub Actions: Handles source control, CI tasks, and workflow automation.
- Azure Pipelines: Enables seamless deployment to Azure App Services.
- Machine Learning API: Serves predictions on Boston housing prices using a pre-trained Scikit-Learn model.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack
- Python, Flask
- GitHub Actions
- Azure Pipelines & App Services
- Scikit-Learn (ML Model)

## üöÄ Getting Started
